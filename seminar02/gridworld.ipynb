    "In this seminar we implement an example of the agent-environment interface used in reinforcement learning, called \"gridworld\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The world consists of an $n \\times m$ grid of squares, indexed by $(i,j)$ with $i = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ and $j = 0, 1, \\dots, m-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the environment consists of the player being in one of the squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible actions are steps in the directions \"UP\", \"RIGHT\", \"DOWN\", \"LEFT\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The rewards and states after each action can depend on multiple factors:\n",
    "- Some squares can give positive/negative rewards\n",
    "- Squares might be \"blocked\" and not possible to step on\n",
    "- Stepping off the board is impossible\n",
    "- Invalid moves might give a negative reward as \"punishment\"\n",
    "- There might be \"portals\" that take the player to a distant square, regardless of their action\n",
    "- There might be deterministic or random effects that change the outcome of actions, e.g. \"wind\" or \"ice\"."
